Services are where the work gets done.  These are the processes that service the requests, process the API calls, get the external data, log the requests, authenticate the users, etc.  You chain services together in a Route to build an application.

Service Examples:

Authenticate User
Authorize User/Request
Log API Access
Retrieve Data

Services in skynet are meant to be chained together serially.  Services that don't modify the response can be called out of band:

		ROUTER ---->   Authenticate User 
				<---   Response
		   		---->   Authorize User 
		    	<---   Response
		   		---->   Log Request (* Async)
		   		---->   Retrieve Data
		    	<---   Response
		   		---->   Cache Response (* Async)

Holy cow, does this need a prettier picture.
